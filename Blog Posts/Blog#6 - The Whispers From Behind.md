The Whispers Form Behind is a first person, 3D, horror, endless runner. Which was created for the GMD1 course.
## Start
The start screen is made to convey the horror aspect of the game. Greeting the player with an eerie music and a dark and gloomy but also dynamic environment.

## Gameplay
As soon as the player starts the game, the character is dropped in the game world already running, in a dark forest. While monstrous footsteps and growls can be heard behind. The front is not much better with the player needing to dodge in order not to hit the incoming obstacles. From in between the trees monsters appear that try to track the player. Fog so thick making it hard to see past a few steps forward.

The only tool at the players disposal for survival is the ability to slow down time. Making it possible to dodge even the toughest of obstacles. But don't stop time for too long or The Whispers From Behind will catch up very fast.

## Upgrades
Failed to escape the purgatory? Mabey these will help - as the player attempts to escape. Each time soul essence is collected. Use that soul essence to fuel your next escape attempt.

## Final Notes
The project smoothly went through the milestones. Each being fulfilled.
1. Gameplay
2. Replayability
3. Immersion

If there was more time these would be the improvements needed:
* Better Optimization of the spawners and objects
* Picking a single style for art, right now it is a mix between semi-realistic and stylized.
* More maps
* Temporary buffs or de-buffs.

These are just some examples, but the possibilities are endless.
## Conclusion
In conclusion this game creation project resulted in a immersive fun yet spooky game that while may not be as spooky as initialy intended I belebe this bacame a more of an arcade game. Which in this case might actualy be better.
