### Gameplay:


Progression: When the player fails, after each run the player is awarded some (soul?) points. With the points the player may acquire upgrades, which should help the player run further. 

Objectives: Run as far as possible, or reach the end of the level

Interactivity: Player can move left or right, slow down the run, sprint, attack, special actions(from acquired upgrades)





### Game systems:

Run System - The player is constantly running forward, can move left or right.

Obstacle System - The run area is littered with obstacles, some that stun, slow, debuff or ever fail the player.

Power Up System - The run area has some power ups that boost the speed, make the player invulnerable(courage?) and give extra life.

Chase system - Player is constantly chased, if the player slows down too much the player will be caught. If the player increases speed, the player will be granted bigger leeway for the chase.

# **World building**

### World:
Purgatory, where the sinned run from the shadows of the past, the environment you run in is the representations of your inner world, the shadows that chase you are the sins, and the obstacles are the actions you have taken.

### Characters:
Main character: Runner
Enemy: Purgatory Keepers
Chaser: Purgatory Retainer

### Story:
The main character is sent to the purgatory in order to repent. The purgatory is the representation of the past, present and future. Meaning the only way for the main character to leave the purgatory is to accept the past and embrace the future in the present.

### Story telling: 
Have milestones that pop up messages with story hints, while slowing down the time.

# **Milestones**
Main endless runner gameplay - run forward while avoiding obstacles and reset when failing.

Progression mechanic - add to the replayability of the game with upgrades.

UI, Polish - Main Menu, UI styling, sound system, visuals, etc.
